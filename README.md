# Disney+ Reimagined

## Description

Step into a world of enchantment with our Disney-inspired platform, where the magic of Next.js 14 meets the efficiency of Microsoft Azure Functions. Powered by Azure OpenAI, our platform offers intelligent movie suggestions based on genres and searched titles, bringing the wonder of Disney classics and modern hits right to your fingertips. Use the genre dropdown to select a genre of entertainment, and enjoy the swift responses facilitated by API calls with caching. With the speed of caching and the elegance of Tailwind CSS & Chakra UI, our interface is as delightful as the movies themselves. Developed with TypeScript for reliability, and deployed seamlessly on Vercel, our platform ensures a smooth and enchanting experience for users worldwide. Get ready to be whisked away on a cinematic journey like never before, where every recommendation is a sprinkle of pixie dust guiding you to your next favorite film.
